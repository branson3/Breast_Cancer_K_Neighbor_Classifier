# Breast_Cancer_K_Neighbor_Classifier
In this notebook we will take data from sklearn's own dataset breast_cancer.  The data is a copy from UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets.  The data is computed from a digitized image of a fine needle\naspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The data contains information on whether these breast masses are malignant or benign. 

We will take this data set and apply a K Neighbors classifier, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The classifier works by normalizing the data, and checking a new data point against the points that it already knows.  It computes the distance between these normalized points and classifies the new point based on what the nearest points are.  The k value that is plugged into the classifier decides how many nearby points to take into consideration when classifying the new point. For example, if you have k = 3, the classifier will consider the three nearest points, and based on whether those points contained a malignant or beign mass.  If the majority of the points nearby signifiy malignant tumors, the model will classify the new point as malignant.

Our goal is to create a K Neighbors classifier model that will be trained on some of our data, and then be able to predict, with a fairly high level of accuracy, whether our testing data contains malignant or benign tumors.
